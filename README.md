# Hotel Booking Exploratory Data Analysis
This project is related to Hotel Booking having two hotel types City Hotel and Resort Hotel. This dataset contains 119390 rows and 32 columns.In this I divide data manipulation workflow in three category Data Collection and understading ,Data cleaning and manipulation and EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).After Data collection and understanding first step to find different columns which is done by coding Head(), tail(), info(), describe(), columns() and some others method. As I moved further I find unique value of each columns and generate a list in tabular form and also check the dataset type of each columnsâ€™ find some columns not in accurate data types which correct it later done in Data cleaning part and as well as duplicates data items must be removed as I find duplicates items equal to 87396 which is dropped from dataset later.
Before visualize any data from the data set I have to do data wrangling. For that, I checked the null value of all the columns. After checking, those null values are replaced by using fillna() function. Then also drop duplicate values using drop_duplicates() function.
Different charts are used for data visualization so that better insights and Business objective is attained.

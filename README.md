## Data cleaning and manipulation:
## **Duplicate values**
Dataset have 31994 duplicate values. so these duplicate values are removedfrom dataset using.drop_dupliactes(). After droping duplicate value shape of the dataset become 87396 rows and 32 columns.
## **Missing values/null values**
Given dataset have 4 columns company, aent, country and children missing values so these values are replace by usin .fillna() function.
## **Adittion of new columns**
Total_people and Total_stay these two columns are added in given dataset
Some rows are removed from columns adults, children and babies.
## EDA:
The EDA is done by using 3 analysis Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis. For the datavisualization following charts are used:

### Univariate analysis:
**In univariate analysis following questions are tried to solve:**
1) Which type of hotel is mostly prefered by the guests?
2) Which agent made the most bookings?
